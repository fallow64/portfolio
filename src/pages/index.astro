        Hello world! I'm a student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison,
        majoring in Computer Science. I'm current working at the <a
          href="https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu"
          >Center for High Throughput Computing</a
        > as a Web Development Intern.

          <a href="https://github.com/fallow64/flama">Flama</a> &mdash; A statically-typed
          programming language written in Rust that compiles to Minecraft using <a
            href="https://mcdiamondfire.com/about">DiamondFire</a
          >, a Scratch-like Minecraft server. It makes creating games for
          DiamondFire easier by moving from a block-based programming language
          to a text-based one.

          > &mdash; A game jam entry for the 2023 Ludwig Game Jam. Worked with a
