# Monospace Everything

There's something deeply satisfying about monospace fonts. Every character takes up exactly the same width, creating perfect alignment and a sense of order.

## The Appeal

**Technical Precision**: In code, alignment matters. Monospace fonts make it easy to visually parse structure.

**Nostalgia**: Monospace fonts remind us of early computers, terminals, and typewriters.

**Clarity**: Each character is distinct and easy to read, even at small sizes.

## In Practice

Here's what monospace looks like in different contexts:

\`\`\`
CODE BLOCK
==========
function greet(name) {
return \`Hello, \${name}!\`;
}
\`\`\`

vs.

\`\`\`
NORMAL TEXT
===========
Monospace fonts work surprisingly well
for body text, especially in technical
contexts.
\`\`\`

## The Verdict

While not suitable for all contexts, monospace fonts are perfect for technical portfolios, documentation, and anywhere you want that hacker aesthetic.
