# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! I've always been fascinated by the aesthetic of terminal interfaces - there's something about the monospace fonts, the command-line interactions, and the minimalist design that feels both nostalgic and modern.

## Why Terminal Design?

Terminal interfaces have a unique charm:

- **Focus on content**: No distractions, just text
- **Developer-friendly**: Feels like home for programmers
- **Timeless**: The aesthetic never goes out of style
- **Accessible**: High contrast and clear typography

## Building This Site

This portfolio uses a brutalist terminal design with:

```bash
$ cat tech-stack.txt
- Astro for static site generation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Monospace fonts throughout
- Terminal-inspired UI components
```

## What's Next?

I'll be posting more about my projects, technical experiments, and thoughts on software development. Stay tuned!
