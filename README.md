# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio! It's made using Astro, a static site generator with
containerized reactivity that I find very cool. The site is hosted at
[austinschneider.dev](https://austinschneider.dev). It's very minimalist but
with time I plan to add some more features, like maybe a contact page or a blog
page.

It's hosted using Github Pages. The main branch is on `main`, and the `prod`
branch is deployed to the actual site.
