# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio! It's made using Astro, a static site generator with
containerized reactivity that I find very cool. It's very minimalist but
with time I plan to add some more features, like maybe a contact page or a blog
page.

# Commands

You can use these commands for Astro: (this is all automatically done by Github
Actions)
